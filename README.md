Responsive Static WebSite for Fotokyttaro.

This is the first static Website I ever made using just HTML, CSS and Javacript.

It is a website for a photocopy business located in Greece, the website is in Greek 
and beyond the basic presentation and information about the business it also gives the user the ability to 
calculate the costs of what they are planning to purchase. ( Not an e-shop just a costs calculator )

To use this calcualator do a pull request or download the code, open the html file in your broswer and then 
navigate to the "Calculator" section with the use of the navigation bar.
Enter the number of photocopies, color settings and dublex options, and get your price.
Same logic for business cards and big posters printing.

The styles folder contains three different CSS files depending on the screen size of the device.

The script.js file contains vanilla JS, without the use of any JS library.
No asynchronous Javascript in this project as there is no need for API interaction. 
This website is completely static.

Please pull or download the code to view this website.
